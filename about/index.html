<h4 id="Education"><a href="#Education" class="headerlink" title="Education"></a>Education</h4><ul>
<li><p>September, 2013 - June, 2017, Bachelor student</p>
<p>  Majored in Environment Engineering (Full English Course)</p>
<p>  School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology<br>  (Canton, China)</p>
</li>
<li><p>October 2017 - February 2018, Research student</p>
<p>  Department of Chemical Systems and Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kyushu University (Fukuoka, Japan)</p>

<h4 id="Programming"><a href="#Programming" class="headerlink" title="Programming"></a>Programming</h4><p>I start to learn to programme very late. I learned <strong>C</strong> language by reading C primer plus for using in my master research. Soon I have found that I have strong interests in software development and programming language. I started to learn other programming languages like <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, even a little Swift. I could not say I am skilled in them. Totally I only know a tiny piece of each of them. But I really enjoy using them to do things. </p>
<p>Except for using C to do plasma simulation, I have used Python and matplotlib to make a small tool for monitoring the simulation of plasma which helps me a lot. Also, I have utilized my programming skill to help other students in my lab to solve some equations. These things make me feel satisfaction and happiness which I never felt from other things like chemistry.</p>
<p>To make up the missed lectures, I started learning some knowledge about computer science and programming by reading textbooks, watching MOOCs and join some lectures of the Department of Information at Kyushu University.</p>
<p>I know the math and algorithm is the most basic lecture for programmed. So I joined the lecture of Probability and Statics and Linear algebra which are for the master student in the Department of Information and I got the credits.  </p>
<p>I have learned <em>Data structure and algorithm</em> by MOOC and books. I have finished 122/961 questions on <a href="https://leetcode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LeetCode</a> as practicing which improved my programming skills. In the next semester, I will join the master lecture about the algorithm of the Department of Information.</p>
<p>Now I am keeping reading some classic books of computer science every day, including </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++ Primer</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective</a>, </li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools</a>, </li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/013359162X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Operating Systems</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am trying to finish reading these books before I get a master degree.</p>
<h4 id="Interests"><a href="#Interests" class="headerlink" title="Interests"></a>Interests</h4><ul>
<li><p>Music</p>
<p>  I mainly listen to rock music and indie pop. Here are some bands and singers I would like to recommend.</p>
<p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Airport" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My little airport</a> (Cantonese, Hong Kong)</p>
<p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_N%27_Roses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guns N’ Roses</a>   (English, U.S.)</p>
<p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Hearts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Blue Hearts</a>   (Japanese, Japan)</p>

<p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheer_Chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheer Chen</a> (Mandarin, Taiwan)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Movie</p>
<p>  I do not pay much time on movies. I do not go to the cinema frequently, except for some commercial movie like Avengers. I usually watch movies followed The Oscar. It helps me save time for selecting. By the way, my favorite Japanese director is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirokazu_Kore-eda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hirokazu Koreeda</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Book</p>
<p>  I am usually fascinated to the wonderful imagination in science fiction, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Galactic_Heroes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legend of the Galactic Heroes</a> (銀河英雄伝説), <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Three-Body Problem</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Story of Your Life</a> (The movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arrival</a> is based on this fiction and received eight nominations at the 89th Oscars. I think it is the best science fiction film in recent years.)</p>
<p>  I was reading Chinese serious literature and poems in a short period in college. I was influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Hua" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yu Hua</a>, a Chinese author whose works mainly focus on the suffering of people in recent China. I also affected by poets in 1980s - 1990s China. These people are lights in darkness at that time, also at this time.</p>
